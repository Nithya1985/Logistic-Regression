Eventhough many independent variables available in the above dataset...

only Age is taken for generating a model with binary data Purchased (0 for buying, 1 for not buying) - binary/categorical

Fetch the dataset .csv form
assign x and y values
Split the x and y data into training and test data.
import packages needed for building regression model
build a model , fit and display the summary
Fix the error scaling
Predict the new values - y
try confusion matrix and finally display the prediction accuracy.
